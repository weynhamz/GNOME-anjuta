The Future!
-----------

On 9th November 2001, it was announced that the two leading GNOME IDE
projects - Anjuta and gIDE - had merged to work on a new IDE application. 
The announcement is reproduced below for information purposes.

What does this mean for the current path of Anjuta development? Since it
is currently a more stable and usable application than Anjuta DevStudio 
("Anjuta2"), the current Anjuta 1.x series will continue to be maintained 
and developed. However, there will be a gradual transition where development 
moves over to the new tree.

[the Anjuta/gIDE merger announcement in full....]

From:          Naba Kumar <kh_naba@users.sourceforge.net>
To:            gnome-devtools@gnome.org

Subject:       [Anjuta-devel] Anjuta and gIDE merged!

Hi all,

The Anjuta and gIDE projects have merged.  The new product will be
called Anjuta Dev Studio, and resides in the anjuta2 module on gnome
cvs.  It is based on the gIDE codebase. The project will be
co-maintained by:

Naba Kumar <kh_naba@users.sourceforge.net> (the former maintainer of Anjuta).
JP Rosevear <jpr@ximian.com> (the former maintainer of gIDE).

The lead developers (besides the above two mentioned co-maintainers) who
will have commit privileges will include:

Dave Camp <dave@ximian.com>,
Stéphane Démurget <demurgets@free.fr>,
Dirk Vangestel <dirk.vangestel@advalvas.be>,
Andy Piper <andy.piper@freeuk.com>.

The rest of the developers from both the sides have to get the patches
approved from the lead developers (as usual). Also, it is requested that
the former anjuta developers be careful with commits to the new module
at first.  We request that changes are discussed with the former gIDE
developers in order to help familiarize everyone with the architecture
and get everyone working on the same page.

The maintainership of related modules (gnome-build, gnome-debug, and
gdl) will remain unchanged.

All developers should read the anjuta2/HACKING file to familiarize
themselves with the policies of the anjuta2 module. The former Anjuta
developers should read anjuta2/docs/extending.txt for an overview of the
gIDE shell and plugin architecture.

Discussion of Anjuta2 development happens on the #devel-apps irc channel
on irc.gimp.org, and the gnome-devtools@gnome.org mailing list.

The name 'anjuta' was selected for the merged project for the following
reasons:

1) Anjuta already has a serious userbase. Continuing the development
under this name will benefit them greatly.

2) Anjuta has a deep emotional significance. It was a gift to Naba's
girlfriend. Therefore, letting it vanish somewhere means betraying their
dedication to the community. :)

3) JP and Dave didn't particularly like the gIDE name anyway.

Cheers,
The New Anjuta Team
