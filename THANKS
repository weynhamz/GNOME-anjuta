Dear all,

I would like to give my heartiest thanks to the following for their
invaluable supports and contributions in making the Anjuta project a
grand success. Without them the project wouldn't have stood where it
is now.

	- Max Blagai <maximblagai@yahoo.com>, for his project proper closing patch,
	
	- Andy Piper <andy.piper@freeuk.com>, for the whole sourceforge resources
	  administration (that's worth to say), all his patches, his nice
	  communication and for its overall support,
	
	- Johannes Schmid <johannes.schmid@gmx.de>, for the gtk--/gnome-- integration,
	
	- Hector Rivera Falu <misha@phreaker.net>, for the whole new anjuta web site
	  design & content management, and his overall artwork on the anjuta project.
	
	- Stéphane Démurget <demurgets@free.fr>, for working on his new project manager
	  for anjuta, which will substitute the current one.
	  
	- Naba Kumar <kh_naba@yahoo.com>, for presenting me this project as a gift of
	  love. I shall value it for whole of my life. :-)


I also extend my heartiest thanks to all the translators for their generous help
in translating the project.
