 <title>Compiling and building programs</title>
  <para>
   Once you have written a C or C++ program, you will probably want to build and run it.
   To compile the current file (if it is a C/C++ source file), click on the 
   <guibutton>Compile</guibutton> button in the extended toolbar, choose the 
   menu item <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Build</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Compile</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, 
   or press <keycap>F9</keycap>. The <interface>Message window</interface> will appear 
   and list all the messages including any compilation errors. You can double-click on the 
   error lines (displayed in red) to go to the particular line where the error occurred. You 
   can define macros, specify include paths, and set the compiler options if you so wish. 
   Compiling a file will save it first, then it will be compiled.
  </para>
  <para>
   Compiling a file does not build an executable. It simply generates an object 
   (<filename>*.o</filename>) file which is later linked to build the executable.
  </para>
  <para>
   To build a file, click on the <guibutton>Build</guibutton> button in the extended toolbar, 
   choose the menu item <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Build</guisubmenu>
   <guimenuitem>Build</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, or press <keycap>F10</keycap>. This will 
   again display the <interface>Message window</interface> listing all the messages that are 
   encountered during the build. The build process will link your object file with libraries 
   and generate the executable. You can specify the libraries to link with your file in the 
   <interface>Compiler Options</interface> dialog (<menuchoice><guisubmenu>Settings</guisubmenu>
   <guimenuitem>Compiler and Linker Settings &hellip;</guimenuitem></menuchoice>)
  </para>

  <para>
   The build process will compile your file first if the object file is not up-to-date 
   or it has not yet been generated. This means that you can build a file without 
   first compiling it. However, when you are dealing with a project rather then a 
   single file, compiling and building are entirely different concepts.
