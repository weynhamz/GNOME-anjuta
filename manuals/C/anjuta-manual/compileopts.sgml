  <title>Setting Compiler Options</title>
  <para>
   You can customize the the way the compiler will compile your file or project.
   Remember, each project will have its own set of compiler settings. If the 
   options are modified when there is no project open, the settings are saved
   separately and will be used when compiling and building single files only. 
   These are all transparent to the user: <application>Anjuta</application> handles 
   them automatically.

   <title>Support for your program</title>
   
   <para>
    You have have seen in the previous sections how to specify basic compile 
    options (such as include and library paths, linker settings, and so on). This 
	process can be cumbersome when you want to use some of the more standard or popular 
	libraries &mdash; GTK and GNOME, for example. To enable easy implementation of 
	these libraries and to avoid and inconsistencies, the developers of such 
	libraries usually supply a configuration program (usually called *-config) 
	along with their libraries.
   </para>
    
   <para>
    Well, that's the theory. Now for the practical part. <application>Anjuta</application> 
	will do the difficult parts for you, so you do not need to worry about the 
	configuration programs for these libraries &mdash; just add the particular 
	<emphasis>support</emphasis> to your project.
   </para>

      and click on the <guilabel>Supports</guilabel> tab in the

     </para>

   <title>Important</title>
   <para>
    Currently, <application>Anjuta</application> has only a few library support 
	options &mdash; Glib, GTK, GNOME and Bonobo. Some of these are not yet 
	fully supported.
   </para>

   <note>
    <title>Remember</title>
    <para>
     Once basic library supports have been specified, there is no need to
     manually set the basic compiler options usually required for these libraries.

   <title>Libraries to link</title>
   <para>
    Libraries are external modules that must be linked with
    your program at the final stage of the build, to produce another 
	library or an executable. The linker is passed the list of libraries to 
	link with to construct the final target.
   </para>
   <para>
     It is also possible to provide the names of object modules
	 (<filename>*.o</filename> files) along with the libraries to link 
	 against. Object modules are specified by a special flag (asterisk *)
     at the start of the object module name (so that 
	 <application>Anjuta</application> can differentiate
     them from the library modules). Object modules must be listed with their 
	 full paths (absolute or relative, depending upon the context), because
     they will not be searched for on the library search path.

    The first is the <guilabel>Enable Debugging</guilabel> option.
    This option tells the compiler to add extra debug information

   </para>
   <para>
    This option will be most useful during the development of your 
	program. When the code is ready for the release, disable this option 
	and build the program again. The project should be cleaned first before 
	the rebuild &mdash; otherwise, due to automatic dependency checking, 
	not all of the files may be built with this option disabled.

    Note that it is not a good idea to enable any sort of optimization if

   <para>
    The second option <guilabel>Enable Profiling</guilabel> is similar to 
	the <guilabel>Enable Debugging</guilabel> option, except that it builds 
	your program with profiling information. Profiling is not yet implemented 
	in <application>Anjuta</application>. For the time being, you can use 
	<application>gprof</application>, a console-based 
    profiler; or <application>MemProf</application>, which is a GUI (GTK) 
	application. Read the <ulink type="man" url="man:gprof">gprof manual 
	page</ulink> to learn how to profile your program. Enabling profiling 
    will make a progam run very slowly, so it should only be used for debugging.
