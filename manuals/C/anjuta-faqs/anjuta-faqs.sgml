    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      What does the name <citetitle>Anjuta</citetitle> stand for? It does 
      not look like one of those recursive names
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      It stands for nothing. Naba Kumar started writing <application>Anjuta</application>, 
      and named it after his girlfriend &mdash; this software is dedicated to her.

     <question>
      <para>
      Is here/will there ever be <citetitle>Anjuta</citetitle> for Windows ?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
		No, unless GNOME itself is ported to Windows first. Anjuta depends a lot on features
		provided by GNOME and UNIX.

   <qandaentry>
    <question>
     <para>
     Where can I find the latest source for <application>Anjuta</application>? There is 
     no CVS repository on the project page at SourceForge!
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
     That is because <application>Anjuta</application> is a GNOME application, and is 
	 in <ulink type="http" url="http://cvs.gnome.org">GNOME CVS</ulink>. You can find 
	 out more about how to obtain the CVS sources at the GNOME site, or at the 
     <ulink type="http" url="http://anjuta.sourceforge.net">project home page</ulink>.
     </para>
    </answer>
   </qandaentry> 

   <qandaentry>
    <question>
     <para>
	I don't have CVS access - how do I access the latest Anjuta source ?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
	Latest nightly tarballs of Anjuta are available 
	<ulink type="http" url="http://anjuta.sf.net/cvs/">here</ulink>.
	You should download the ANJUTA_1_0_0 branch sources since HEAD is currently
	unstable and will probably not build.
     </para>
    </answer>
   </qandaentry> 

   <qandaentry>
    <question>
     <para>
	There is no configure script in CVS version !
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
	You'll have to generate the configure script using the autogen.sh script that
	is included with the distribution. Note that you will need compatible versions of
	automake, autoconf and libtool.
     </para>
    </answer>
   </qandaentry> 


    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      When I build the <application>Anjuta</application> source, I get compiler errors 
	  for some missing header files / missing library / etc.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      The missing header files probably belong to the GNOME libraries. You may have 
      an old version of the GNOME libraries. You should upgrade to a full GNOME 1.4
	  installation. <ulink url="http://www.ximian.com/" type="http">Ximian</ulink>
	  provides pre-built packages for many Linux distributions.
      </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
		I can't compile <application>Anjuta</application> - complains about missing
		package. But I have the package RPMs installed.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
		If you want to compile Anjuta from source tarballs/CVS, you'll need the devel
		versions of the packages as well. For example, Anjuta requires gnome-print. So,
		you'll need to install gnome-print as well as gnome-print-devel.
      </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      When I try to build <application>Anjuta</application> from source, 
	  <application>make</application> fails in the <filename class="directory">intl</filename> 
	  directory.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      Look at the output from <application>configure</application>. There may be 
	  errors like:
	  <screen>
      checking for xgettext... (cached) /usr/bin/xgettext
      checking for catalogs to be installed...  es fr it ja pl ru sv tr uk
      sed: can't read ./intl/po2tbl.sed.in: No such file or directory
      creating ./config.status
      creating Makefile
      creating intl/Makefile
      sed: can't read ./intl/Makefile.in: No such file or directory
      creating po/Makefile.in
      </screen>
	  This means that the build failure is probably due to the infamous 
	  <application>gettext</application> bug. This sometimes causes the files required 
	  to build message translations to be destroyed (note: this is not an 
	  <application>Anjuta</application> issue!). You should reinstall 
	  <application>gettext</application> or use a working version. version 0.10.x
	  if known to work well.
      </para>

   <!-- ============= Installation =========== -->
   <qandadiv>
    <title>Installing <application>Anjuta</application></title>
 
    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      Can I install <application>Anjuta</application> locally, in my home directory?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      It is best to do a system installation (as root) and not local installation. 
      <application>Anjuta</application> depends on GNOME for supplying pixmaps, and 
      the help system works with <application>gnome-help-browser</application> 
      or <application>Nautilus</application>, none of which will be happy if you do a 
      local installation.
      </para>
	  <para>
	  Having said that, Anjuta mostly works fine from a local installtion and Anjuta
	  hackers do it all the time.
	  </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
		Installation hangs while executing create_global_tags.sh.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
		This is a known problem with some distributions. Basically, there is a recursive
		include loop in some of the files Anjuta is trying to parse. You'll have to manually
		identify and fix the loop, or create a dummy system.tags file.
	  </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
		I get lots of jade errors while building documentation.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
		You probably do not have updated Docbook stylesheets and/or OpenJade. You can ignore
		the errors since Anjuta will install fine even if the documentation could not be built.

     <answer>
      <para>
      Because you haven't added them ? This is free software. You are free to, even encouraged

     <para>
		Why doesn't Anjuta compile/work on my favourite platform ?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>

      Where is the GNOME2 version of Anjuta ?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      Anjuta is being re-written for GNOME2. the GNOME2 version is called Anjuta2 and shares
	  virtually no code with Anjuta. If you want to know details, post to the gnome-devtools
	  mailing list.

      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      If you want to improve Anjuta's editor, it is beter to hack on
	  <ulink url="http://www.scintilla.org/" type="http">Scintilla</ulink> instead.
	  Anjuta simply uses the Scintilla editor widget with some minor changes.

     </question>

		Start with Anjuta2. You will need a full GNOME2 installation. Asking quesitons

     <para>
		 What is the correct way of including the GTk header files in my applications ?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
		It depends on the GTK verion you are using. If you are using GTK 1.x, you should add
		the output of 'gtk-config --cflags' to your compiler flags. If you are using GTK 2.x,
		you'll need to use the command 'pkg-config --cflags gtk-2.0' instead.

    <answer>
     <para>
		In general, to link against any external library which has a name lib[name].a or

		Should I use Anjuta 1 or Anjuta 2 ?
    </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
	Currently, Anjuta is more usable than Anjuta2. However, most of the development effort is
	concentrated on Anjuta2, so if you're looking for powerful new features, Anjuta2 is the
	likely candidate for implementation. Also, Anjuta2 is a full GNOME2 application while Anjuta
	is dependent on GNOME1 libraries. For long-term investment, Anjuta2 is a better option.
