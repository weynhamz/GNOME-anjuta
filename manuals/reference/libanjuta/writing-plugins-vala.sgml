  <title>Writing plugins in Vala</title>
  <para>
    Before writing an Anjuta plugin, please read
    <xref linkend="anjuta-architecture"/> for general concepts about how Anjuta 
    plugins interact with Anjuta Shell and other plugins.
  </para>
  <para>
    Anjuta API is divided in two namespaces : Anjuta and IAnjuta. Anjuta
    contains API to interact with the IDE, and IAnjuta contains interfaces that
    plugins implement to be able to interact with each other.
    Writing a plugin for Anjuta is as simple as subclassing Anjuta.Plugin,
    overriding activate and deactivate, and writing a .plugin file to let Anjuta
    know about your plugin.
  </para>
  <para>
    This tutorial is still uncomplete. However most of the documentation
    regarding C plugins is still applicable, so you can always refer to
    <xref linkend="writing-plugins">it</xref>.
  </para>
  <para>
    In this tutorial, we will write a basic <emphasis>Hello world</emphasis>
    plugin that does nothing but adding a "Hello World" label to Anjuta.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="writing-code">
    <title> Writing the plugin code </title>
    <para>
      As said earlier, we will need to subclass Anjuta.Plugin and override some
      methods, so here is Anjuta.Plugin :
      <programlisting>
public class Anjuta.Plugin : GLib.Object {
        public uint add_watch (string name, Anjuta.PluginValueAdded added, Anjuta.PluginValueRemoved removed);
        public bool is_active ();
        public void remove_watch (uint id, bool send_remove);
        public virtual bool activate ();
        public virtual bool deactivate ();
        public weak Anjuta.Shell shell { get; set; }
        public signal void activated ();
        public signal void deactivated ();
}
      </programlisting>
      The methods we'll need to override are activate and deactivate, the shell
      property is what we'll use to interact with Anjuta. <methodname>add_watch</methodname>
      and <methodname>remove_watch</methodname> are used to interface with the
      <emphasis>Values System</emphasis> see <xref linkend="anjuta-architecture"/>
      for more information. The rest is pretty self explanatory, and we generally won't need it.
    </para>
    <para>
      We will only use the <methodname>add_widget</methodname> method of 
      <type>Anjuta.Shell</type> in this tutorial. For more informations, you can see
      the <link linkend="AnjutaShell">C API documentation</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      This plugin does nothing more than showing a "Hello World" widget in
      Anjuta 
    </para>
      <programlisting>
using Gtk;
using Anjuta;

public class HelloWorldPlugin: Plugin {
    /* The hello world widget */
    Widget widget;

    /* We use the "override" keyword to override the virtual methods activate and deactivate */
    public override bool activate () {
        widget = new Label("Hello World");

        /* adding the widget */
        shell.add_widget(widget, /* the widget to add */
                         "AnjutaHelloWorldPlugin", /* name of the widget*/
                         "HelloWorldPlugin", /* title, should be translated */
                         Gtk.STOCK_ABOUT, /* icon stock id */
                         ShellPlacement.CENTER); /* placement in in the shell */
        return true; /* false if activation failed */
    }

    public override bool deactivate () {
        /* remove the widget we've added */
        shell.remove_widget(widget);

        return true; /* false if plugin doesn't want to deactivate */
    }
}

/* Initialization function, in C this would be automatically generated by the
   ANJUTA_SIMPLE_PLUGIN macro */
[ModuleInit]
public GLib.Type anjuta_glue_register_components (GLib.TypeModule module) {
    return typeof (HelloWorldPlugin);
}
      </programlisting>

    <title>Writing a plugin description</title>
    Anjuta needs a file with a plugin extension to know about our plugin, its name
    and description, where it is located, when to load it. Here is an example for our
    basic plugin :
    <programlisting>
[Anjuta Plugin]
Name=Hello World
Description=An example hello world plugin.
Location=anjuta-hello-world:HelloWorldPlugin
Icon=anjuta-sample-plugin-48.png
    </programlisting>
    Generally, Name and Description should be translated. Using intltool, you can
    do this by prefixing them with _.
    Location is of the form libraryname:ClassName : libraryname is the name of the
    library file (without the lib prefix and .so suffix), and ClassName is the full
    class name including the namespace (and not separated by a period as you would 
    write it in Vala).
    Icon is the icon to be used by the plugin, here we put sample plugin icon which
    is distributed along with Anjuta, but you could put your own icon instead.
    <para>

    <title>Compiling and installing the plugin</title>
    <sect2>
      <title>Manual compilation</title>
      Assuming you saved the plugin as hello-plugin.vala, you can compile it with :
      <userinput>
valac --ccode --pkg libanjuta-1.0 hello-plugin.vala
gcc -shared -o libanjuta-hello-world.so
      </userinput>
