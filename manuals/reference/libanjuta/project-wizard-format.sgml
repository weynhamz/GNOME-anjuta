	<title>New Project Wizard format</title>
	<para>
		The new project wizard has been rewritten for Anjuta 2. It
		is a generic plugin able to create different kind of projects.
		The files needed by each project and the associated graphical
		interface used to get user choices are defined in a text file
		read by the plugin. This documentation will described the
		format of this file which is called a template.
	</para>

	<sect1 id="overview">
		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
			The template file <emphasis>looks like</emphasis> a
			xml document. It is divided in four parts:
			an header block, one or more page blocks, a content block
			and an optional action block. The file is read several times, one
			time for each block but before reading it,
			the whole file go though a transformation pass and only
			the resulting file must be a valid xml file. The transformation
			pass use <ulink url="http://autogen.sourceforge.net">autogen</ulink>.
		</para>
		<para>
		<emphasis>Autogen</emphasis> is a quite complete text transformation program, 
		it is able to make string substitutions, conditionally
		generate text, include files and it can even be extended with the
		guile language. Autogen takes as input a template file which is
		the wizard template file and some definitions which are generated
		at run time according to the user choices. Note that the first
		line of an autogen template need to have special format not
		compatible with an xml file, so this line is added at run time
		when needed. It defines the
		start and end macros marker of autogen which is fixed and
		defined as "[+" and "+]" in the wizard template.
		</para>
		<para>
		The <emphasis>header</emphasis> block is the only exception, it is read 
		directly from the template file and do not use autogen.
		It must be the first block and must be valid a xml
		block, that's why the first line of the template could not
		contains the autogen special line. The parsing is stopped when
		 the end of this block is
		reached, so we do not care for the remaining of the file. This
		block contains informations about the project kind like a name and
		a short description.
		</para>
		<para>
		The <emphasis>page</emphasis> blocks are read one by one after being transformed by
		autogen, they define some properties of the project which could
		be changed by the user, things like project name or use of a
		particular library. The graphical interface is created at run
		time according to these properties. Each page is generated when
		the user has completed all previous pages.
		You can ask the user for something on one
		page and his answers become available as autogen variables for
		generating the next page. You can, by example, skip a complete page
		for configuring a CVS reposit, if the user has decided to
		not use it. In case you insert or remove a complete page you need
		to take care to not do it before one already displayed.
		</para>
		<para>
		When all pages have been displayed. The program will read the <emphasis>content</emphasis>
		block which defined all files and directories needed by the project.
		This block goes through autogen so you can use this to adjust file
		names and paths. Typically, at least creating a project file with
		the name given by the user. Note that the project files itself are
		transformed with autogen if needed.
		</para>
		<para>
		Finally, if it exist the <emphasis>action</emphasis> block is read and the
		corresponding commands are executed in their order of apparition.
		Typically, it is useful for
		loading in Anjuta the newly created project.

				This is one of the most important element. A property

				and a variable in the autogen definition file used to
				control the generation of the project.
			</para>
			<para>
				The type attribute define the kind of property. The following
				types are defined
				<variablelist>
					<varlistentry><term>hidden</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							This is the only property that does
							not correspond to any widget. This
							is useful to defined additional
							autogen variables using only
							name and default attributes. As this
							value cannot be changed by the user
							the default attribute defined the
							value of the property.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>	
					<varlistentry><term>boolean</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							This correspond to a boolean variable.
							It is represented by a toggle button. The
							value is 1 if the user select Yes, and 0
							if the user select No.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>	
					<varlistentry><term>integer</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							This correspond to a integer number. It
							is represented by a spin button. The
							value is the corresponding number.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>	
					<varlistentry><term>string</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							This is a string value represented by
							an entry box. The value is the text
							of this entry box.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>	
					<varlistentry><term>list</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							This property takes its value in
							a list of values and is represented
							by a list box. All the values
							are defined with child item
							element defined below. The value of
							the property is defined by the name
							attribute of the corresponding item.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>	
					<varlistentry><term>directory</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							This property get a directory selected
							by the user. The directory could be
							inexistent, see the exist attribute for
							more information. It looks like a string
							property with a Browse button.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>	
					<varlistentry><term>file</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							This property get a file selected
							by the user. It is very similar to
						       	the directory property.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>	
					<varlistentry><term>icon</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
							This property is quite similar to the
							file property and allow you to select
							an icon. The property value will be
							the name of the file containing the icon.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>	
				</variablelist>
			</para>
			<para>
				name is the name of the autogen variable corresponding

			</para>
			<para>
				label is a translatable label that appears near the entry
				widget.
			</para>
			<para>
				description is a translatable description that appears
				as a tips of the entry widget.
			</para>
			<para>
				default is the default value of the property. If none is
				specified the property is empty.
			</para>
			<para>
				mandatory allow you to define if an empty value is
				acceptable, by default it is allowed. If you set it to
				yes and the user does not enter a value, he will get an
				error message and cannot go further.
			</para>
			<para>
				exist allow to check if a file or a directory
				corresponding to the value of the property exist. If exist
				is set to no, a warning message is displayed if the file or
				the directory exist. Moreover the value of the default
				property is tested and a number is automatically added at the end
				to avoid the warning message if necessary.
				By default or if exist is set to yes,
				no check is made.
			</para>
			<para>
				summary defined if the property and its value should
				appears at the end of the wizard. This happens if the

			<para>
				name is the name of the item, the property variable will be
				set with this value if the item is selected.
			</para>
			<para>
				label is an optional translatable name for this item.
