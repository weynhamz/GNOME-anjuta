  <title>Debugger: Execution</title>
  <para>
   The program execution in debugger can be finely is controlled. You can execute
   the program in single steps or let is continue till it encounters a breakpoint. Executing
   the program in such a manner is very essential for tracking the program behaviors.
   In other words, like a video editing session, the program is executed in <citetitle>slow motion</citetitle>
   and you have the remote control to forward, pause, stop etc.
  </para>
  <para>
   Followings are the way you can execute the program in the debugger.
  </para>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg_step_in">
   <title>Single stepping (step in)</title>
   <para>
    Single stepping executes only one statement of the program (from where
    ever it has stopped) and returns the control to you. If the statement that is 
    executed contains one or more functions, then it tries to step inside the functions also
    (in the sequence the functions are executed). Once the statement is executed and
    the control is passed to you, you can study the various program parameters.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the program has not been currently started when you step in, then the program will
    be started and will be stopped at the first statement of the program (ie the first
    statement in the function main).
   </para>
   <para>
    You can single step in program by activating
    <citetitle>Debugger-&gt;Execution-&gt;Step in</citetitle>
    or by clicking the step in icon in the debug tool-bar.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="dbg_step_over">
   <title>Single stepping (step over)</title>
   <para>
    <citetitle>Step over</citetitle> is exactly similar to <citetitle>step in</citetitle>,
    except that it won't step inside any function in the statement being executed.
    The statement will be executed in one go.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can single step over the program by activating
    <citetitle>Debugger-&gt;Execution-&gt;Step over</citetitle>
    or by clicking the step over icon in the debug tool-bar.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg_step_out">
   <title>Single stepping (step out)</title>
   <para>
    Step out will execute the current function till it is returned. The program
    will be stopped once it exits from the function. To be frank, Step out
    is not single stepping, because it does not executes a single statement.
    It will execute the whole function (till it returns to the calling function).
    But I somehow didn't know what to call it other than <citetitle>Step out</citetitle>. Probably,
    I should have called it <citetitle>Run till return</citetitle>
    or <citetitle>Finish the function</citetitle>.
    Never mind, I hope it is understood what this command does.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can single step out the program by activating 
    <citetitle>Debugger-&gt;Execution-&gt;Step out</citetitle>
    or by clicking the step out icon in the debug tool-bar.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg_run">
   <title>Run/Continue</title>
   <para>
    This will continue the execution of the program till a breakpoint is encountered or
    the program exits.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the program is not yet started, then the program will be started and continued.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can continue the program by activating
    <citetitle>Debugger-&gt;Execution-&gt;Run/Continue</citetitle>
    or by clicking the Run/Continue icon in the debug tool-bar.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg_stop">
   <title>Stop Program</title>
   <para>
    This will kill the the program which is being debugged. Remember
    you cannot stop an attached process.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can stop the program by activating <citetitle>Debugger-&gt;Stop Program</citetitle>.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg_restart">
   <title>Restart Program</title>
   <para>
    This will stop the program first and then restart it again. All the 
    breakpoints will remain in effect. Remember you cannot restart an
    attached process.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can restart the program by activating <b>Debugger-&gt;Restart Program</b>.
