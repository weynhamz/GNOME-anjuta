  <title>Debugger: Others</title>
  <para>
   Now let us have a look at the other debugger features which are used
   less frequently, but nevertheless handy.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="dbg_kernal">
   <title>Kernel Signals</title>
   <para>
    Kernel signals is a way of signaling between processes in Linux. You
    can get the list of signals available for the program by activating
    <citetitle>View-&gt;Kernel Signals</citetitle>.
    This will bring up a window which will list all the signals available in you system along with
    their brief description.
   </para>

   </para>
   <para>
    You will also find three columns which specifies what to do when the signal is
    received:
   </para>
   
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para><citetitle>Stop:</citetitle>
      This tells the debugger whether to stop the program execution (and return the control to you) 
      when the program receives this signal.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para><citetitle>Print:</citetitle>
      This tells the debugger whether to Display the received signal.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para><citetitle>Pass:</citetitle>
      This tells the debugger whether to pass the signal to the program.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
   
   <sect2 id="dbg_kernel_beh">
    <title>Changing the behavior</title>
    <para>
     You can change the way debugger behaves when a particular signal is
     received. To change it, select the signal in the given list. Right click to pop-up
     the operation menu. Activate <citetitle>Modify Signal</citetitle>. This will bring up a dialog
     box. You can set the three behaviors and click OK to commit the change.
    </para>

   <sect2 id="dbg_kernel_send">
    <title>Sending the signal to the program</title>
    <para>
     You can explicitly sent the signal to the program being debugged. To
     do this, select the signal in the given list. Right click to pop-up
     the operation menu. Activate <citetitle>Send to process</citetitle>. A confirmation will be
     asked. Click OK to confirm. This will send the signal to the program.
    </para>
   </sect2>
   <sect2 id="dbg_kernel_update">
    <title>Updating the signal list</title>
    <para>
     Activating the menu item <citetitle>Update</citetitle>
     from the operation menu (right click to pop it up)
     will refresh the Kernel signals window.
    </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>
 
  <sect1 id="dbg_registers">
   <title>Cpu registers</title>
   <para>
    You can examine the contents of CPU's (microprocessor) internal registers.
    Activate <citetitle>View-&gt;Registers</citetitle>. A window listing all the available registers
    in the microprocessor and their corrosponding contents will appear. Right click
    on the window to popup operation menu.
   </para>

  </sect1>
 
  <sect1 id="dbg_dyna_libs">
   <title>Dynamically loaded Libraries</title>
   <para>
    To get the listing of the dynamic libraries used by you program, activate
    <citetitle>View-&gt;Shared Libraries</citetitle>. This will bring up a window which will
    list all the shared libraries your program has loaded and their locations
    in the memory. It is also told if the symbol table is loaded or not (Yes/No).
   </para>
   <para>

  </sect1>
 
  <sect1 id="dbg_interrupt">
   <title>Interrupting the program</title>
   <para>
    While the program has got the control, you can not perform any debugging task.
    If you want back the control while the program is running,
    Activate <citetitle>Debug-&gt;Interrupt program</citetitle>.
    This will interrupt the program and give you the control back.
   </para>
   <para>
    Of course, for the interruption to work properly, you should set the debugger behaviour
    for this interrupt signal (SIGINT) to the value [ Stop:Yes, Print:Yes, Pass:No ]. This is
    also the default value. So, unless you modify it, it will remain like this. See
    <citetitle>Kernal signals</citetitle> to find out what it means and how it is set.
