  You'll sometimes find the built-in functionality provided by Anjuta to be
  insufficient. In these cases, you might be tempted to either add the
  feature yourself to the Anjuta codebase or submit a feature request to
  implement the feature. However, both approaches are likely to be slow
  and problematic, especially if your tool is a specialized one. In these
  circumstances, it is advisable to use the Anjuta tools framework instead.

  Anjuta provides a powerful framework for defining user-defined tools for
  extending its functionality. Tools have access to almost all features of
  the IDE through the use of variables. You can add tools under any menu item,
  specify input, output and error redirection within the GUI framework and
  supply command-line parameters to the tool.
