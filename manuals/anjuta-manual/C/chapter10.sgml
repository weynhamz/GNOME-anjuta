  <title>Debugging: Breakpoints</title>
  <para>
   While you are debugging a program you would like to break the execution of the program at
   some location, probably because you want to study the state of the execution at that location.
   Breakpoints are what that come into picture. You set breakpoints at different locations in your
   source file and let the program run. When it encounters any breakpoint, it will suspend the
   execution of the program. You can then do whatever you want, such as evaluate expressions,
   inspect variables, study the stack trace etc at that location.

  </para>
  <para>
   By <citetitle>Location</citetitle>, I mean the location of the code in your source
   file. You will be frequently prompted for locations. <citetitle>Location</citetitle>
   can be specified in any of the following formats:
  </para>
  <para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem><para> File_name:Line_number </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para> Function_name </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para> File:Function_name </para></listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   The first one is very obvious. The location refers to the line number "Line_number" in the
   source file "File". The second one refers to the first line of the function "Function_name".
   The third one is similar to the second one except that it is used when you have more than
   one function with the name "Function_name" in your program. You differentiate them by
   giving "File" which will refer to the function "Function_name" in the file "File".
  </para>
  <para>
   With every breakpoint, You may associate two parameters. They are:
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem><para> Break condition </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para> Pass count </para></listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   The <citetitle>Break condition</citetitle> is a valid C expression
   which should evaluate to a boolean data. That is
   The evaluation of the expression should result in either TRUE(1) or FALSE(0). If the final evaluation
   value is not a boolean data, then it will be appropriately type casted to boolean data.
  </para>
  <para>
   Every time the breakpoint is encountered during the execution, the break condition will be evaluated.
   The debugger will break the execution only if the evaluation results in a TRUE value, otherwise
   it will continue the execution as though there had been no breakpoint.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <citetitle>pass count</citetitle> is an integer (unsigned) value which tells the debugger to skip the 
   breakpoint that many times before it is considered. Pass count has higher priority than the
   break condition. Only when the pass count reaches zero will the debugger evaluate the break
   condition (if it is present). If there is no break condition, the debugger will break the execution
   on pass count zero.
  </para>
  <para>
   The default value of Break condition is always TRUE. That is the debugger will break the
   execution at the breakpoint location.
  </para>
  <para>
   The default value of the Pass count is zero. That is the breakpoint will be considered
   on its first encounter itself.
  </para>

    Bring up the 'Breakpoints editing window' by activating <citetitle>View-&gt;Breakpoints</citetitle>

   <para>
    Enter the location where you want to set the breakpoint. Optionally, you may also enter
    the <citetitle>Break condition</citetitle> and the <citetitle>Pass count</citetitle>
    in the appropriate entry boxes. Click OK to set the breakpoint.
   </para>
   <para>
    Alternatively, you may also set the breakpoint by highlighting the function name in the editor
    and activating <citetitle>Debug-&gt;Breakpoints-&gt;Set Breakpoint</citetitle>
    (or clicking the Set breakpoint icon on the <citetitle>Debug Toolbar</citetitle>).

     <title>Things to note:</title>
     <para>
      When you start the debugger, all the breakpoints will be set. Those breakpoints
      which are old (i.e.. the source file is more recent than the breakpoint), will be
      disabled.
