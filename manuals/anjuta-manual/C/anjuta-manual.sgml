 <!-- ============= Document Body ============================= -->

 <!-- ============= Introduction ============================== -->
 <chapter id="introduction">
  <title>Introduction to Anjuta</title>
  <para>
   Anjuta is a very versatile Integrated development environment for
   c and c++ (Gnu/Linux). Written in gtk/gnome and written for gtk/gnome,
   it features many advanced programming tools and utilities. It is basically
   a GUI interface for the bunch of command line programming utilities
   and tools available for Linux, which are usually run in console and
   are very un-user friendly.
  </para>
  <para>
   Anjuta is an effort to marry the flexibility and power of text
   based command line tools with the ease of graphical user interface
   of gnome. That's why I have, with all my might, made it as much as
   user friendly interface as possible.
   Please have a look at the screen-shot.
  </para>

  <para>
   Presently, Anjuta is only in Beta release and lots of work are to
   be done to improve it. I hope in the 
   future Anjuta is going to be much more 
   capable and stable. Extensive debugging session
   has not yet been performed.
   So, undoubtedly, it will have lots of bugs. It will be
   my pleasure if you use it and
   report the bugs to us. That way, you will
   be helping to improve the software as well as helping the open-source community.
  </para>

  <para>
   Any sort of suggestions or 
   patches for anjuta are also most welcome.

 <!-- ============= Getting Familier: Menus  ============-->
  <sect1 id="menu">
   <title>Menus:</title>
   <para>
    The top most part of the Anjuta IDE is the menu bar. Almost all of the
    functionalities are available by activating the appropriate menu item. The
    functions have been grouped according to their type of operations. For
    instance, most of the file and project operations have been grouped in the
    sub-menu 'File'. Similarly, The other sub-menus contain the operations they
    are grouped to.

    <para>
     The main menu is detachable. Drag it from the
     main window using the handle at the extreme right. Once it is
     detached, it will become a floating menu.
    </para>
    
    <para>
     All the Sub-menus in the main menu are detachable. You can detach
     it by clicking the detach bar on the sub-menu (just above the first
     item). Once the sub-menu is detached, it will be shown as an
     independent window. A detached menu is shown as an illustration.

    To make the life easier, all those operations which are performed very
    often are made available from the tool-bars. There are basically four
    tool-bars on the main window.

    It would be worth spending some time getting familiar with the tool-bar
    buttons. Tool tips describing the function of the tool-bar buttons will appear
    as soon as you move the mouse over the buttons. Read and remember them
    carefully. Tool-bars avoid the unnecessary selection of menu items which are
    used very often.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    You will find some combo (entry) boxes on the tool-bars. They are explained
    in the later section.
   </para>
 
   <para>
    Similarly, to make the life still more easier, short cuts are available for
    those operations that are performed very often. All the keyboard short cuts
    are given along with their corresponding menu item. You must remember some of
    them, for they become handy while you are typing into the editor and you don't
    want to leave the keyboard.

   <para>
    In the main window, there are three frames that you must be familiar with,
    before you start doing anything (All of them may not be visible when you start
    Anjuta). They are called:
   </para>
   
   <para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Editor window.
      </para>
     </listitem>

      <para>
       Project window.

       Message window.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>
   
   <para>
     The frame on the left is the <citetitle>Project window</citetitle>, on the right is the
     <citetitle> Editor window</citetitle> and the one at the bottom is the
     <citetitle>Message window</citetitle>.
     The project window and the message window can be detached into separate
     windows instead of docking them into the main window. You can detach them by
     clicking the the detach button (You will find them along with the frames: the
     small buttons with the un-docking icon). Similarly, you can hide them, by
     clicking the hide buttons (small buttons with the red cross). You can make
     them visible anytime by activating the menu items View/Project listing and
     View/Message, respectively, or by clicking the corresponding tool-bar buttons
     in the main tool-bar.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <citetitle>Editor window</citetitle> is the part of the main window, so you can
       either detach nor hide it. But, you can always detach the individual
       documents, which are shown as pages in the editor window. Editor window
       will have one document active at a time (if there is any file opened). All
       the file commands are meant for this active document. You can switch to
       any page by clicking on the page tag. You can do the same by right
       clicking on the page tags and selecting the document from the pop up menu
       that will appear. This is especially useful when you have many files
       opened and all the files not visible in the page tag area.

     <para>
     </para>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <citetitle>Project window</citetitle> shows the project files if you have a
       project opened. Otherwise, the project window is usually hidden. Double
       clicking on any item in the project window will open that file.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <para>
     </para>
     <listitem>
      <para>
      <citetitle>Message window</citetitle> will list all
       the messages (both stdout and stderr outputs) when an external command is
       executed. Message window is usually hidden, but appears as soon as the
       external command is executed, such as during file or project compilation
       or building, during debugging session, searching in files and many other
       operations requiring external commands. Anjuta also adds its own messages
       whenever it becomes necessary.
      </para>
      <para>
       The colors with which the messages are displayed in the message window
       are very important to note. Messages displayed in normal color (usually
       black) are normal messages. Those displayed in Blue are usually important
       messages such as error messages or some important information. Messages
       shown in Red color are <citetitle>Hot linked</citetitle>. That is double
       clicking on such
       a message will take you to the particular file and line number specified
       in the message.
      </para>
      <para>
       For example, when you compile a buggy file, some messages in red will
       appear in the message window which tell where is the error and what sort
       of error is that. Double clicking on such messages will open the file and
       hi-lite the line containing the error.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </para>
   <tip>
   <title>Try resizing and detaching</title>
   <para>
    All these three frames are resizable and detachable. Try adjusting them by dragging the
    handle bars separating them. For detaching, click the detach button on the top
    corner of the windows.
   </para>
   </tip>
   <para>
    One last thing I should tell you in this section is that, all the settings,
    including all the window sizes and window positions, are saved when you exit
    Anjuta  Then they are all set again when you next restart Anjuta  Session
    management is still under development. So you should not exit Anjuta with any
    unsaved document. Of course, Anjuta will display a warning if you try to exit
    Anjuta with unsaved document(s) still opened.

    To create a new file just select the menu file/new or click the new file icon
    in the main tool-bar. A new page will appear on the editor (or a new window if
    the parent document is windowed). This new document will be named "newfile#1",
    "newfile#2", "newfile#3" ... and so on. You must  save new documents as soon
    as possible to avoid any data loss due to emergency exit or application
    crash.

     One more thing you must keep in mind is that, if you have enabled
     auto-save, it will not auto-save any new file(s). You must first save it/them
     manually. Only then will the auto-save work for them too. Same is applied for
     the save all. Save all will not save the new file(s), if you haven't saved

    Select the type of the tag you want to view in the tag pull down menu in the browser 
    tool-bar. If the tag type is function or class, you will have to further select the file for 
    which you want to view the tag. Then select the tag (function, class member or the
