Introduction:
-------------

Anjuta is a very versatile Integrated development environment for c and c++ (Linux).
Written in gtk/gnome and written for gtk/gnome, it features many advanced programming
tools and utilities. Besides many other, it has project management, application widzards,
onboard interactive debugger, and a powerful source editor with source browsing.

Anjuta is an effort to marry the flexibility and power of text based command line tools
with the ease of graphical user interface of gnome. Please have a look at the screenshot. 

Presently, Anjuta is only in Beta release and lots of work are to be done to improve it.
I hope, in future, Anjuta is going to be much more capable and stable. Extensive
debugging session has not yet been performed. So, undoubtedly, it will have lots of bugs.
It will be my pleasure if you use it and report the bugs to us. That way, you will
be helping to improve the software as well as helping the open-source community. 

Any sort of suggestions or patches for anjuta are also most welcome.
