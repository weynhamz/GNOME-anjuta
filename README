Introduction:
-------------

Anjuta is a versatile Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C and C++. 
It has been written for GTK/GNOME, and features a number of advanced
programming facilities. These include project management, application
wizards, an on-board interactive debugger, and a powerful source editor
with source browsing and syntax highlighting.

Anjuta is an effort to marry the flexibility and power of text-based 
command-line tools with the ease-of-use of the GNOME graphical user 
interface. That is why it has been made as user-friendly as possible.

At present, Anjuta is only a beta release and lots of work needs to be done to 
improve it. In the future, Anjuta is going to be much more capable and stable! 
Extensive debugging has not yet been performed, so at the moment it will 
undoubtedly have lots of bugs. It would be great if you use it and report any 
problems to us. That way, you will be helping to improve the software as well 
as helping the Open Source community. Please read the file COPYRIGHT for
details. 

Any sort of suggestions or patches for Anjuta are also most welcome.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

Installation should be a breeze on any reasonably up-to-date *NIX system
with GNOME 2.x .The following are the minimum requirements. Until the code
reaches some kind stability it is always good to use the latest stable
version of the libraries

1) Installation
# From Tarball:
	* GTK libs (2.0 or later)
	* GNOME libs (2.0 or later)
	* gnome-xml (aka libxml1) (1.4.0 or later)
	* gnome-print
	* gdk-pixbuf
	* scrollkeeper
	* pkgconfig
	* gnome-build (from GNOME CVS, no tarball yet)
	* gdl (from GNOME CVS)

	Optional:
	* glade3 (from GNOME CVS) to build glade plugin
	* libsvn (www.subversion.org) to build subversion plugin

# From CVS:
	* All the requirements for tarball
	* GNU gettext 0.10.x (or later)
	* Automake 1.4 (or later)
	* Autoconf 2.13 (or later)


2) Running
	* X-Windows, any window manager should do as long
	as the gnome libs are installed)
	* Bash command shell
	* GNU Indent
	* yelp to browse docs
	* Automake/Autoconf
	* GNU Make
	* GNU C/C++ compiler
	* GNU debugger (gdb)
	* GNU grep
	* For cvs plugin: cvs

INSTALLATION:
-------------

# From Tarball:
	Note:- The package as an example is taken as anjuta-1.0.tar.gz
	and '#' is the shell prompt. You must be logged in as root to
	install Anjuta.

	1) Get the tarball
	2) copy it to your home dir.
	3) tar xfzv anjuta-<version>.tar.gz
	4) Change dir:   # cd anjuta-<version>
	5) Type:  # ./configure
	6) Type:  # make
	7) Type:  # make install

	That's all. If everything went smoothly, congratulations. If not,
	then please check that you have the latest libgnome and libgnomeui
	installed. Get them if you don't have and repeat the above steps.


KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------
	* Printing is unstable with older versions of gnome-print and FreeType.
	If you experience crashes while printing, please upgrade gnome-print
	and FreeType to the latest stable versions (currently 0.36 and 2.1.2
	respectively).
	
	* Debugger stepping may not work correctly if executables are compiled
	with optimization enabled (This is a GCC/GDB issue). If you plan to
	debug your application from Anjuta, please turn off optimization for
	debug builds.

	* Building anjuta on Debian (sid) may find a couple of issues related
	to zvt library. If you encounter such problem, temporarily move out
	any libzvt2 libraries that you can find. Build/install anjuta and
	restore the libzvt2 libs.
	
	* Building anjuta n Debian (sid) may also find gnome-terminal to be
	interfering. Uninstall it temporarily and restore it after installing
	anjuta. The above two debian (sid) problems may not apprear if anjuta
	rpms are installed.
	
	* Some versions of gettext (0.11.x) prompts to press Enter in the
	middle of project build (in anjuta). This will be a problem, as there
	is no known way to provide user feedback in anjuta message manager.
	Upgrade your gettext to higher version which does not exhibit this
	problem. gettext 0.11.40 and above should be just fine.
	
	* Calltips flicker when the cursor touches them if you have your window
	manager set to follow-mouse-cursor for focus. Change it to focus-follow
	mouse click to fix it.
	
RUNNING:
--------

To run Anjuta, choose Development->Anjuta from the GNOME Main Menu, 
or type:   # anjuta

If you get the shell error 'Command not found', then make sure your PATH
variable contains the executable path of Anjuta binary (by default:
/usr/local/bin). Usually, the PATH variable is set in the file
/etc/profile. Check it out.

Usage: anjuta [--no-splash | -s] [ files ...] [ project ]

If you do not want to see the Anjuta splash screen / logo, run Anjuta with 
the command-line option "--no-splash". See the User Manual for further
instructions.


** Good Luck **
