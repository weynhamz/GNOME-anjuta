	o Compiler options: supports
	o Different types of projects: executable/library/shared-library etc.
	o Being able to open a source rpm (.src.rpm) or a .tgz tarball and have it
	  imported as a project

	o Debugger optimization

	o Confirm root before program installation
	o Utilities
	o Integration with glade, gtranslator, eog and other bonobo components
	
	o Enabling/disabling calltips in preferences.
	o Double/single click open file in preferences.

	o Use GtkHTML if available to browse online documentation/manuals
	o easy (S)RPMS & Debian packages build
	  (assistant and/or edit the spec or debian dir)
	o use PHP vars like C ones (with the tags bar); easy since they all
	  begin with $

	  Well, that's a problem with the GtkPanedWindows, but I thing we make a
	  temporary work around fix in anjuta by capturing the resize signal of
	  the concerned widgets. Anybody care to have look in it? :-)

	  So, watch out guys! Atleast don't miss the beer. :-)
	  

BUGS:
-----
- In a C++ projects, checking for the gtkmm and gnomemm packages

- For whatever reason db1-devel_1.85-4mdk was not installed by default and
ld gave me errors (can't find -ldb1). Checking for db1 dependency (both rpm and configure).

- Tooltips that pop up for a function (eg. "printf(") persist
onscreen when changing source files. If you edit file 2 and
return they disappear. Tooltips need to be tied to the present
editing panel.
