TODO List:
----------

** Immediate post-1.0.0:

	o Add ignore modules in Project config: Tagmanager does not ignore them.
	o Bring all indent/format preferences under one tab.
	o Add more editor preferences.
	o Add "indicator.automatic" pref in message prefs.
	o Compiler options: supports
	o add credits for ALL new contributors
	o update manual
	o improve find in files usability/incremental searching
	o project manager changes
	
** General:

    o Comments in source files
	o Being able to open a source rpm (.src.rpm) or a .tgz tarball and have it
	  imported as a project
	o Debugger optimization
	o Utilities
	o Integration with glade, gtranslator, eog and other bonobo components
	o Double/single click open file in preferences.
	o Use GtkHTML if available to browse online documentation/manuals
	o easy (S)RPMS & Debian packages build
	  (assistant and/or edit the spec or debian dir)
	o use PHP vars like C ones (with the tags bar); easy since they all
	  begin with $

	  Well, that's a problem with the GtkPanedWindows, but I thing we make a
	  temporary work around fix in anjuta by capturing the resize signal of
	  the concerned widgets. Anybody care to have look in it? :-)

	  So, watch out guys! Atleast don't miss the beer. :-)
